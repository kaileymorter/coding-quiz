This javascript quiz is a timed 5 question quiz.

When the user clicks start, a countdown timer of 90 seconds will start.

The user will be presented with a multiple choice question and upon what their answer is, a script will appear telling them if they got the answer right or wrong. 

If they got the answer right, their score in the upper left hand corner of the screen will increase.

If they got it wrong, their score will decrease and they will lose time on the timer in the right hand corner of the screen. 

After they've answered the question, then they will click the "next" button to go to the next question.

After completing the quiz or if they run out of time, a prompt will come up that asks for their name to log their score.
The prompt will disappear and then the user will have the choice to restart the quiz.
